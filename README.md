# GBF-Tweetdeck-Addon
A utility tool for Granblue Fantasy.

This started as a fix for [@iteratorP](https://twitter.com/iteratorP)'s [plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/granblue-tweetdeck-copier/ggjpfidpfbnjjdecmffaldmhkfjoccnl), and I figured that since I spend so much time playing this game - I might as well do it more efficiently.

Features:

+Supports EN and JP Tweets, directly from Tweetdeck.

  +Will not copy any ID that the game couldn't generate under natural conditions.
  
    -Does not currently support coop IDs (like anyone really uses those, though).
  
Planned features:

+actually learning how to js

+options for copying IDs

+joining raids through the context menu/potential viramate raid id injection***
